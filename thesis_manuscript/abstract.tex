Optical (atmospheric) turbulence ($C_{n}^{2}$) is a highly stochastic process that can apply many adverse effects on imaging and laser propagation systems. Modeling atmospheric turbulence conditions has been proposed by physics-based models but they unable to capture the many cases. Recently, machine learning surrogate models have been used to learn the relationship between local environmental (weather) and turbulence conditions. These models predict a turbulence strength at time $t$ given weather at time $t$. This thesis proposes a technique to forecast four hours of future turbulence conditions from prior environmental parameters using artificial neural networks. First, local weather and turbulence measurements are formatted to input sequence and output forecast pairs. Next, a grid search is performed to find the best combination of model architecture and training parameters. The architectures investigated are the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and three variants of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Finally, the selected model is applied to the test dataset and analyzed.
