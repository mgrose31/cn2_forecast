First I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Watson, for his patience and support of my interests.

I am grateful to my colleagues at MZA Associates Corporation for their support of my continuing education. I especially want to thank Dr. Matthew Whiteley,  Dr. Yakov Diskin, and Dr. Jason Schmidt for mentoring me for nearly three years at the time of this thesis. I am a better scientist because of them.

I am also grateful to Dr. David Bromwich for first accepting me as an undergraduate research assistant. I'd like to recognize Dr. Sheng-Hung Wang for giving his time to work with me.

Finally, I'd like to thank Dr. Shawn Ryan from my undergraduate studies for first introducing me to research and continuing to provide thoughtful advice many years later.
