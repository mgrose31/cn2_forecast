\begin{enumerate}
	\item Improve data preprocessing techniques to fill small gaps in weather or $C_{n}^{2}$ measurements.
	\item Investigate whether the model performance declines if some data is missing in a sequence.
	\item Further investigation into the sensitivity input feature counts (sensitivity analysis)
	\item Extend the grid search to include different number of epochs, learning rates (and decays), and fewer input variables
\end{enumerate}
