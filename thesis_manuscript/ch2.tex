\chapter{EXTREMELY LONG CHAPTER TITLE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES ACROSS MULTIPLE LINES.}
\label{ch2}

Write your second chapter here -- for example, a problem
statement. Notice that you can refer to other chapters like this: in
Chapter \ref{ch1} the reader will find a literature overview.

Again, we might want to break this chapter up into sections.

\section{Section 1}

Section 1 goes here.

\section{Section 2}

Section 2 goes here.

An example of a figure is here:

Once I have a picture, then I use a software program called GIMP (GNU image manipulator program) to convert my picture into a .eps file (embedded post script).  The rest is easy...
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centerline{\epsfysize 7cm  \epsffile{Drew_Eric.eps}}
    \caption{Dr. Murray throwing Eric off of the
		Great Wall of China.}
    \label{fig:Drew_Eric}
\end{figure}
We can reference this figure as Figure \ref{fig:Drew_Eric}. 

For a second figure, let's use the UD logo.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centerline{\epsfysize 7cm  \epsffile{UDlogo.eps}}
    \caption{University of Dayton Logo}
    \label{fig:UD_logo}
\end{figure}
Again, we can reference this figure as Figure \ref{fig:UD_logo}.
